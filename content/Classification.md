## No Free Lunch
There is no optimal algorithm that works for every case

### Discriminative
 - Learn the data boundary (Directly predict the labels from data)
	 - Logistic Regression
	 - [[SVM]]
	 - Boosted Decision Trees
### Generative
 - Represent data + boundary (Can make use of conditional independence, priors)
	 - Naive Bayes Classifier
	 - Bayesian Network
