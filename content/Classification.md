A discrete supervised learning technique

## No Free Lunch
There is no optimal algorithm that works for every case

**1. Discriminative**
 - Learn the data boundary (Directly predict the labels from data)
	 - [[Logistic Regression]]
	 - [[SVM]]
	 - [[K Nearest Neighbors Classification]]
	 - Boosted Decision Trees
**2. Generative**
 - Represent data + boundary (Can make use of conditional independence, priors)
	 - [[Naive Bayes Classifier]]
	 - Bayesian Network
