# UNDERSTANDING THE SUPPLY CHAIN

1. **What is supply chain management? Will a supply chain always look like a ‘chain’?**
   Supply chain management is the coordination of all activities involved in producing and delivering a product, from raw materials to the customer. A supply chain doesn't always look like a simple chain; it can be a network with multiple connections and interactions.

2. **Should the members of a supply chain maximize individual profits in order to increase the overall supply chain surplus? Explain.**
   No. If each member focuses only on their own profits, it can lead to conflicts and inefficiencies. To increase the overall supply chain surplus, members should collaborate and work together to optimize the entire system.

3. **What are some strategic, planning, and operational decisions that must be made by H&M, a Swedish apparel retailer?**
   - **Strategic Decisions:** Choosing new countries to enter, setting sustainability goals, and selecting brand partnerships.
   - **Planning Decisions:** Deciding on seasonal collections, organizing marketing campaigns, and managing the supply chain schedule.
   - **Operational Decisions:** Managing inventory in stores, scheduling staff work hours, and handling customer service.

4. **Consider the supply chain involved when a customer purchases a cup of coffee at a local café. Identify the cycles in this supply chain and the location of the push/pull boundary.**
   - **Cycles:**
     - Replenishment: Ordering coffee beans and supplies.
     - Manufacturing: Brewing the coffee.
     - Customer: Selling the coffee to customers.
   - **Push/Pull Boundary:**
     - Push: Stocking coffee beans and supplies in advance.
     - Pull: Making the coffee when a customer orders it.

5. **Consider the supply chain involved when a customer buys a garment from apparel retailer Benetton, which is similar to the L.L. Bean example discussed in the chapter. Identify the push/pull boundary and two processes each in the push and pull phases.**
   - **Push/Pull Boundary:**
     - Push: Producing clothes based on forecasts.
     - Pull: Making or ordering clothes based on customer demand.
   - **Push Processes:**
     1. Producing standard styles.
     2. Distributing clothes to stores.
   - **Pull Processes:**
     1. Customizing orders based on requests.
     2. Reordering popular items based on sales.

6. **In what way do supply chain flows affect the success or failure of a firm such as Benetton? List two supply chain decisions that have a significant impact on supply chain profitability.**

# ACHIEVING STRATEGIC FIT IN A SUPPLY CHAIN

1. **How would you characterize the competitive strategy of the Swedish furniture retailer IKEA? What are the key customer needs that IKEA aims to satisfy?**
   IKEA’s competitive strategy is low-cost furniture with a wide range of designs. The key customer needs are affordability, convenience, and variety in styles.

2. **How would demand uncertainty and implied demand uncertainty differ for a product like the iPhone 6s Plus?**
   Demand uncertainty is the unpredictability of total sales. Implied demand uncertainty is estimating future demand based on current trends or customer behavior.

3. **What would be the impact of increasing product variety on implied demand uncertainty faced by a supermarket chain like 7-Eleven?**
   Increasing product variety raises implied demand uncertainty, as it becomes harder to predict which products customers will choose.

4. **Does implied demand uncertainty correlate with the characteristics of demand, particularly for high markdown products? Why?**
   Yes. High markdown products have unpredictable demand because sales fluctuate with price discounts, making it harder to forecast sales.

5. **Reconsider the previous four questions for other companies—an online book seller like the U.K.-based Book Depository, a retailer like the French multinational Carrefour, an automotive manufacturer like the Japanese multinational Toyota, and a discount retailer like the British supermarket retailer ASDA.**
   - **Book Depository:** Competitive strategy is a large selection with free worldwide shipping. Key needs are variety and convenience.
   - **Carrefour:** Competitive strategy is wide product range and competitive prices. Demand uncertainty depends on product categories.
   - **Toyota:** Competitive strategy is reliable, fuel-efficient cars. Demand uncertainty depends on economic conditions.
   - **ASDA:** Competitive strategy is low prices and variety. Implied demand uncertainty increases with more promotions.

6. **It is important to have strategic fit between a supply chain and its competitive strategy. What is the supply chain design that would fulfill this purpose? List the capabilities it should have.**
   The supply chain design should match the company's strategy. Capabilities include flexibility, efficiency, reliability, quality management, and technology integration.

7. **What do you expect the level of implied demand uncertainty to be for jasmine rice produced by Thailand sold at a supermarket? Explain your answer with reference to Fisher’s model.**
   Implied demand uncertainty would be low because jasmine rice is a staple product with predictable demand, as described in Fisher’s model for functional products.

8. **Assume a new drug has been developed for the Ebola virus (EVD). Briefly describe the new drug’s demand and supply characteristics at the beginning of its product life cycle.**
   Demand would be uncertain and specialized for Ebola patients. Supply would be limited due to high production costs and strict regulations.

9. **What are some problems that can arise if the same roles are assigned to different stages of a supply chain in order to achieve a strategic fit? Describe how roles should be assigned to help a retailer and a manufacturer work together to expand the scope of strategic fit.**
   Overlapping roles can cause confusion and inefficiency. Roles should be clear: manufacturers focus on production, retailers on customer service. Collaboration and information sharing help expand strategic fit.

10. **With the help of examples, identify the five basic levers that can be used to deal with uncertainty in a supply chain. Describe the role of each lever in enabling a supply chain to achieve strategic fit and effectively serve the target customer segment.**
	   1. **Inventory:** Extra stock reduces the risk of shortages.
	   2. **Capacity:** Ability to increase production during high demand.
	   3. **Flexibility:** Adaptability to change product lines or volumes.
	   4. **Information:** Sharing data helps with better decision-making.
	   5. **Collaboration:** Working with partners to manage supply chain uncertainties.


# SUPPLY CHAIN DRIVERS AND METRICS

1. **Are there any exceptions to the claim that sourcing decisions are always an important factor affecting the supply chain performance for all industries?**
   Yes. In some service-based industries where physical products are minimal, sourcing decisions might be less critical compared to other factors like service quality or customer experience.

2. **The flow of information is becoming increasingly important in supply chain management. Describe the key effects of information on supply chain performance in terms of responsiveness and efficiency with reference to the logistics industry.**
   - **Responsiveness:** Better information allows faster reaction to customer needs and changes.
   - **Efficiency:** Accurate information helps reduce costs and optimize routes in logistics.

3. **Discuss the following proposition with reference to an automobile garage that handles maintenance and repair: “Modal choice decisions could improve the responsiveness of the supply chain performance.”**
   Choosing different service methods (like in-person vs. online booking) can make the garage respond faster to customer needs, improving overall service speed.

4. **“Price decisions only affect buyers’ behavior and not the responsiveness of the supply chain.” Comment on this statement with reference to shipping logistics.**
   This is not true. Pricing can influence shipping choices, such as faster delivery options, which affects how quickly the supply chain responds.

5. **Consider a retailer like Marks & Spencer (M&S), which is outsourcing parts of its delivery services to a logistics provider. When should such a company choose to operate its own account operation to provide delivery services?**
   M&S should operate its own delivery when it needs more control over delivery quality, speed, or to better meet specific customer service standards.

6. **What would be the effects of high-low pricing adopted by a supermarket chain on supply chain performance?**
   High-low pricing can lead to fluctuating demand, making inventory management harder and increasing the risk of stockouts or excess inventory.

7. **Identify examples of industries in which product customization by the end customer has proliferated while still maintaining short lead times and competitive pricing. How have the supply chains in these industries adapted to deliver such products?**
   - **Example:** Custom computers from companies like Dell.

8. **How can the full set of logistical and cross-functional drivers be used to create strategic fit for a furniture manufacturer, specializing in kitchen cabinetry, that targets both time-sensitive and price-conscious customers?**
   By balancing fast delivery with cost-effective production, using efficient logistics and coordinated functions to meet both quick and affordable needs.

9. **Which supply chain drivers should a firm focus on to improve its profit margins?**
   - **Inventory Management:** Reducing excess stock lowers costs.
   - **Operational Efficiency:** Streamlining processes to save time and money.

10. **What is the role of supply chain drivers in improving a firm’s asset turnover? Refer to the key components of asset turnover to support your answer.**
	Supply chain drivers like inventory management and efficient operations help use assets better, increasing sales relative to asset value and improving asset turnover.

# DESIGNING DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS AND APPLICATIONS TO OMNI-CHANNEL RETAILING

1. **What effect does the geographic disparity of customers in a large country, like India or China, have on selecting the number of distributors needed to supply, for example, electrical white goods such as fridges to retailers? Refer to the supply chain costs that such a decision might lead to in your answer.**
   Geographic disparity increases transportation costs and delivery times, so more distributors may be needed to ensure efficient supply. This decision may lead to higher costs for managing multiple warehouses but can lower delivery costs and improve service levels.

2. **A large, European white goods manufacturer is considering expanding its operations to China using a range of products, localizing some to suit the specific needs of the Chinese market. All localization work is carried out in China. Note that localization generally relates to elements of a product rather than the entire product. What sort of distribution network should this company use?**
   The company should use a **local distribution network** with warehouses close to customers in China to handle localized products efficiently and meet local demand quickly.

3. **A distributor has heard that one of the major manufacturers from which it buys is considering going direct to the consumer. What can the distributor do about this? What advantages can it offer the manufacturer that the manufacturer is unlikely to be able to reproduce?**
   The distributor can offer **strong local relationships** with retailers, **better knowledge** of local markets, and **efficient logistics** for smaller, frequent orders, which the manufacturer may struggle to reproduce on its own.

4. **What type of distribution network is typically best suited for the sale of “click-and-collect” apparel items?**
   A **hybrid distribution network** with centralized warehouses for online orders and local stores for customer pickup is best suited for click-and-collect apparel.

5. **What are the advantages of using the drop-shipping distribution network?**
   - **Low Inventory Costs**: Retailers don’t need to stock products.
   - **Wide Product Range**: Retailers can offer more products without holding inventory.
   - **Reduced Risk**: Fewer unsold goods to manage.

6. **Consider an online shopping website like Amazon, which implements the drop-shipping arrangement to reduce inventory costs. What are some of the disadvantages such online retailers would face with this system?**
   - **Longer Delivery Times**: Shipping can take longer because the supplier is responsible.
   - **Less Control Over Quality**: Retailers rely on suppliers for product quality and packaging.
   - **Customer Service Issues**: Harder to handle returns and complaints.

7. **Using the purchase of an engagement ring as an example, identify whether a brick-and-mortar retailer or an online shop is the most appropriate retail channel(s) for this type of product. How should the selected channel perform in terms of customer service elements?**
   A **brick-and-mortar retailer** is more appropriate for engagement rings, as customers may want to see and feel the product before purchasing. The retailer should offer personalized service, product education, and the ability to customize orders.

8. **Consider an auto parts retailer implementing distributor storage with last-mile delivery. List some advantages and disadvantages that the retailer would experience with this method.**
   - **Advantages**: 
     - Lower inventory costs.
     - Faster delivery to customers.
   - **Disadvantages**:
     - Higher transportation costs.
     - Complexity in managing last-mile delivery.

   **Home Depot** would benefit more from adding an online channel due to its larger scale and ability to offer a wide range of products online, combined with the convenience of in-store pickup or delivery.

10. **Amazon sells books, music, electronics, software, toys, and home improvement products online. In which product category does going online offer the greatest advantage compared with a retail store chain? In which product category does the online channel offer the smallest advantage (or a potential cost disadvantage) compared with a retail store chain? Why?**
   - **Greatest Advantage**: **Books and electronics**, because they are easy to ship and often don’t require physical inspection.
   - **Smallest Advantage**: **Home improvement products**, as customers may prefer in-person shopping to see or test items.

11. **Why should an online seller such as Amazon build more warehouses as its sales volume grows?**
	Building more warehouses helps reduce delivery times and costs, improves service levels, and allows Amazon to stock more products closer to customers.

12. **Amazon has opened bookstores and announced the opening of convenience stores. How can these traditional retail channels allow Amazon to complement its online channel effectively?**
    Physical stores provide **immediate product access**, **enhance brand presence**, and can serve as **pickup locations** for online orders, offering a seamless shopping experience across both channels.

# NETWORK DESIGN IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN

1. **How do the location and size of warehouses affect the performance of a firm such as IKEA? What factors should IKEA consider when deciding where and how big its warehouses should be?**
   The location and size of warehouses affect delivery speed, inventory costs, and transportation costs. IKEA should consider factors like customer demand, proximity to stores, transportation costs, and regional regulations when deciding where and how big its warehouses should be.

2. **How do import duties and exchange rates affect the location decision in a supply chain?**

   - **Exponential Smoothing**
   - **Holt’s Model**
   - **Winter’s Model**
   - **Suitable Method:** Exponential smoothing is more suitable for cold supply chain management due to the need for quick adjustments in demand changes.

5. **As a supply chain manager, do you need to forecast the random component of the observed demand for products that displays seasonal demand?**
   No, you don't need to forecast the random component separately. Focus should be on the overall pattern and seasonality.

6. **Identify any six factors that should be taken into consideration when implementing demand forecasting in a department store.**
   1. Historical sales data
   2. Seasonal trends
   3. Promotions or discounts
   4. Economic conditions
   5. Competitor actions
   6. Customer preferences

7. **List the five basic steps of demand forecasting in supply chain management. Which step is more important?**
   1. Data collection
   2. Data analysis
   3. Selecting forecasting method
   4. Making forecasts
   5. Monitoring and updating forecasts
   - **Important Step:** Data collection is the most important because accurate forecasts depend on reliable data.

8. **What different situations need to be considered when applying the following forecasting methods: moving average; simple exponential smoothing; Holt’s model; and Winter’s model?**
   - **Moving Average:** Stable demand with no trend or seasonality.
   - **Simple Exponential Smoothing:** Stable demand with no seasonality.
   - **Holt’s Model:** Trend in the demand but no seasonality.
   - **Winter’s Model:** Trend and seasonality in the demand.

9. **What is a forecasting error? How can a manager use this information?**
   A forecasting error is the difference between actual demand and the forecasted demand. Managers use it to adjust and improve future forecasts.

10. **What error forecasting measures are associated with moving average; simple exponential smoothing; Holt’s model; and Winter’s models? How can the measures be grouped according to their use?**
   - **Moving Average:** Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
   - **Simple Exponential Smoothing:** Mean Squared Error (MSE)
   - **Holt’s Model:** Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)
   - **Winter’s Model:** Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
   - **Grouped by Use:** Measures can be grouped based on their focus on either accuracy (MSE, RMSE) or consistency (MAE, MAPE).
