## Games in Normal Form

What does it mean to say what an agent is __self-interested__?
- It does not necessarily mean that they want to cause harm to each other
- It does not necessarily mean that they care only about themselves
- It means that each agent has his own description of which sates of the world he likes, and acts based on this description
The dominant approach to modeling an agent’s interest is __utility theory__ (measure of self-interested)
- Aims to quantify an agent’s degree of preference across a set of available alternatives
- Aims to understand how these preferences change when an agent faces uncertainty about which alternatives he will receive
- We assume that agents actions are consistent with utility –theoretic assumptions.
A __utility function__ is a mapping from states of the world to real numbers
- These numbers are interpreted as agent’s level of happiness in the given states
- Confronting uncertainties, utility is defined as the expected value of his utility function with respect to the appropriate probability distribution over states

Agents needs to choose action that maximizes expected utility
But it gets complicated if there are two or more utility maximizing agents which can effect each other
