- Firm-level Scope 1 (direct) & Scope 3 (supplier) emissions: **Trucost**
	- ![[Pasted image 20250227175820.png|400]]
- **Domestic Pressure**:
	- State-level regulations → ↑ outsourcing to countries with weaker environmental laws.
	- High-emission industries & polluting-input sectors outsource most.
- **Profit Motive**:
    - Firms with ↑ Scope 3 emissions → ↑ profits (via leaner domestic production).
    - No link between profits and imported emissions.
- Carbon tax did motivate firms to outsource to reduce scope 1, 2 emissions
	- But the entire supply chain emission would rather increase

# Solutions

__Scope 3 carbon tax__ - Hard
1. Complexity of Scope 3 Emissions Accounting
	- Data reliability, double counting
2. Policy & Regulatory Challenges
	- Company taxed based on emissions from suppliers from another country?
	- One country does this and the others not: Trade disadvantages
	- **Enforcement difficulties**: Governments would need extensive tracking systems

__Carbon Tariffs (CBAM)__
- Applies to carbon-intensive industries:
	- Cement, Iron, Steel, Aluminum, Fertilizers, Electricity, Hydrogen
- Steps:
	1. Emissions are measured based on
		- Actual emissions from the producer
		- If not disclosed, default values set by the EU
	2. Purchase CBAM Certificates
		- If the imported product has higher emissions than an equivalent EU-produced product
		- Price of these certificates matches the EU ETS carbon price
		- Already paid a carbon tax in their own country $\rightarrow$ deduct this from the CBAM obligation
	3. Surrender CBAM Certificates Anually
		- Number of tickets equivalent to the carbon emissions embedded in their imports
- Stockpiling CBAM certificates is available but to a limited extent
	- Certificates expire
	- Cannot trade or resell

	- 탄소 관세가 있어도 탄소 누출은 발생할 수 있음
	- 그러나 탄소 누출이 발생하더라도 글로벌 배출량은 감소하는 효과 확인
