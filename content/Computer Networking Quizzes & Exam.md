## Quiz Answers

**What is not in the network edge?**
- **Routers** - Routers are typically considered part of the network core, not the edge. The network edge generally includes hosts and end-systems like PCs, smartphones, and local networks, rather than the routing centers of the internet.

**True or false? Propagation delay is a function of the distance and the medium.**
- **True** - Propagation delay is influenced by the length of the path the signal must travel and the propagation speed of the medium (such as copper wire, fiber optic cable, or air).

**What is the most popular physical medium used in access networks?**
- **Twisted pair** - Historically and currently, twisted pair cables are widely used in access networks, especially for telephone and Ethernet networks, due to their cost-effectiveness and sufficient performance for broad ranges of applications.

**True or false? Transmission delay is a function of the distance.**
- **False** - Transmission delay depends on the data rate of the link and the size of the data being transmitted, not the distance over which the data travels.

**True or false? Queueing delay is a function of the distance.**
- **False** - Queueing delay is influenced by the traffic load and the capacity of the links, not directly by the distance.

**True or false? A bottleneck link on the path from a sender to a receiver is fixed, regardless of the time of the day or cross traffic.**
- **False** - Bottleneck links can vary depending on the volume of traffic and the network conditions at different times, making them dynamic rather than fixed.

**True or false? On a path from a sender to a receiver, a bottleneck link refers to the most constrained link and may change over time.**
- **True** - A bottleneck link is the link with the lowest capacity along a path and can indeed change over time due to varying network conditions and traffic patterns.

**With whom did Vint Cerf win the Turing Award?**

**What does an application-layer protocol define? Mark all that apply.**
- **Types of messages exchanged**
- **Message syntax**
- **Message semantics**
- **Rules**
- Application-layer protocols define how data is structured (message syntax), what the data means (message semantics), the types of messages that can be sent and received, and the rules for managing communication.

**What is used to identify a process in an end host in networking applications? Mark all that apply.**
- **Port number**
- **PID**
- In networking, a process is typically identified by a port number which is used alongside an IP address to direct network traffic to specific applications. The PID (Process ID) is also used internally within an operating system to identify processes.

**What does RTT stand for?**
- RTT stands for **Round-Trip Time**, which is the time it takes for a signal to travel from the source to a destination plus the time it takes for an acknowledgment of that signal to return to the source.

**Is HTTP stateless?**
- **Yes**, HTTP is stateless, meaning each request from a client to server is treated as new, with no memory of past interactions.

**Persistent HTTP saves on TCP connection setup overhead over non-persistent HTTP. Yes or no?**
- **Yes**, persistent HTTP saves on TCP connection setup overhead because it reuses the same connection for multiple requests and responses, rather than establishing a new connection for each request.

**Who sets the HTTP cookie?**
- **Web server**
- A web server sets an HTTP cookie, which is then stored on the client's browser.

**Where are your cookies on your smartphone saved?**
- Cookies on a smartphone are saved in the device's internal memory within the specific browser's storage used to access websites.

**What is the MX type in a DNS RR for?**

**Yes or no? KAIST runs the authoritative name server and the local DNS server on separate machines.**
- Without specific information on KAISTâ€™s DNS infrastructure, I canâ€™t confirm whether they run the authoritative and local DNS servers on separate machines, but it is common practice to do so for reasons of load management and security.

**Yes or no. DNS has a hierarchy of two layers: root servers and TLD servers.**
- **No**, DNS hierarchy includes more than just root servers and TLD (Top-Level Domain) servers; it also includes authoritative name servers, making it more than a two-layer hierarchy.

**Yes or no? Hostname to IP address mappings are cached at the local DNS servers with TTLs.**
- **Yes**, local DNS servers cache mappings of hostnames to IP addresses with Time To Live (TTL) values, which dictate how long the information should be stored before being refreshed.

**In BitTorrent, a file is chopped into chunks and a peer may receive chunks from multiple peers. In order to prevent selfish peers from leaving after only receiving from other peers and not sending any chunk out, what policy does BitTorrent employ?**
- **Tit-for-tat; a peer unchoke only those top peers that are sending chunks at highest rates.**
- BitTorrent employs a tit-for-tat strategy to encourage cooperation among peers by favoring those who contribute more to the network.

**What does TTL stand for?**
- TTL stands for **Time To Live**, a mechanism that limits the lifespan or the number of hops that data packets can take before they are discarded by a network router.

**Name a non-electronic item that comes with a TTL.**
- A non-electronic example of TTL can be seen in perishable goods such as food items which have a "best before" date.

**If the .com TLD server address has a TTL value of 24hrs and there are 10 million DNS queries for .com domain per hour, then how many DNS queries should the local DNS server send to the .com TLD server in a day?**
- **1**
- Only one query per day needs to be sent to the TLD server if the TTL is set for 24 hours, assuming the data does not change.

**At the receiver, the UDP layer uses only the destination port number for demultiplexing. Yes or no?**
- **Yes**, UDP uses the destination port number to determine which application process should receive incoming packets.

**A UDP socket receives packets from not only a single IP address and a port number pair, but multiple pairs of IP addresses and port numbers. Yes or no?**
- **Yes**, UDP sockets can receive packets from multiple pairs of IP addresses and port numbers, as UDP is connectionless and does not maintain a dedicated connection state.

**In the UDP header, there is a sequence number field. Yes or no?**
- **No**, there is no sequence number field in the UDP header.

**In the UDP header, there is a checksum field. Yes or no?**
