Greenwashing occurs when an organization spends significantly more resources on "green" advertising than on environmentally sound practices.

TerraChoice, an environmental consulting division of [UL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UL_(safety_organization) "UL (safety organization)"), described "seven sins of greenwashing" in 2007 to "help consumers identify products that made misleading environmental claims":[16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwashing#cite_note-16)

1. "Hidden Trade-off": a claim that a product is "green" based on an unreasonably narrow set of attributes without attention to other critical environmental issues.
2. "No Proof": a claim that cannot be substantiated by easily accessible information or a reliable third-party certification.
3. "Vagueness" is a poorly defined or broad claim that the consumer will likely misunderstand its meaning. "All-natural," for example, is not necessarily "green."
4. "Worshipping False Labels": a claim that, through words or images, gives the impression of a third-party [endorsement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testimonial "Testimonial") where none exists.
5. "Irrelevance": a claim that may be truthful but unimportant or unhelpful to consumers seeking environmentally preferable products.
6. "Lesser of Two Evils": a claim that may be true within the product category, but risks distracting consumers from the more significant environmental impact of the category.
7. "Fibbing": a claim that is simply false.

The organization noted that by 2010, approximately 95% of consumer products in the U.S. claiming to be green were discovered to commit at least one of these sins.[17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwashing#cite_note-17)[18](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwashing#cite_note-18)

According to the [United Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations "United Nations"), greenwashing can present itself in many ways: 

1. A company can put out claims saying that they are eco-friendly or green while not putting any plans in place to do so.
2. Being intentionally vague about operations or using vague claims that cannot be specifically proven (like saying they are “environmentally friendly” or “green”).
3. Saying that a product does not contain harmful materials or use harmful practices that they would not use anyway.
4. Dictating one thing the company does well regarding the environment while not doing anything else.
5. Promoting products that meet minimum requirements rather than making improvements.[19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwashing#cite_note-:4-19)

Activities deemed to be characteristic of greenwashing can vary by time and place, product, and the opinions or expectations of the person making the determination.[8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwashing#cite_note-Harvard-8)

## Examples

- Clothing company [H&M](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%26M "H&M") came under fire for greenwashing their manufacturing practices as a result of a report published by _[Quartz News](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz_News "Quartz News")_.[29](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwashing#cite_note-29)
- In 2009, [McDonald's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald%27s "McDonald's") changed the color of its European logos from yellow-and-red to yellow-and-green; a spokesman explained that the change was "to clarify [their] responsibility for the preservation of natural resources."[30](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwashing#cite_note-30) In October 2021 McDonald's was accused of greenwashing after announcing its pledge to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.[31](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwashing#cite_note-31)
- In 2018, in response to increased calls to ban plastic straws, [Starbucks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starbucks "Starbucks") introduced a lid with a built-in drinking straw that contained more plastic by weight than the old straw and lid together (though it can be recycled, unlike its predecessor).[32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwashing#cite_note-32)
- Volkswagen [fitted their cars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_emissions_scandal "Volkswagen emissions scandal") with a "defeat device" that activated only when a car's emissions were being tested to reduce polluting emissions. In normal use, by contrast, the cars were emitting 40 times the allowed rate of nitrogen oxide.[35](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwashing#cite_note-35) Forbes estimates that this scandal cost Volkswagen [US$](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US$ "US$")35.4 billion.[36](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwashing#cite_note-36) Other automakers [also cheated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diesel_emissions_scandal "Diesel emissions scandal") on emissions systems.[37](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwashing#cite_note-37)
