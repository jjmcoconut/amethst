### Basic Concepts

1. [[Periodicity]]
	Presence of regular and repeating patterns or cycles in the data over a specific time interval.
	
1. Seasonality
2. Trend

1. [[Likelihood function]]
	Given a probability density or mass function $x \mapsto f(x|\theta)$ the likelihood function is $\theta \mapsto f(x|\theta)$ 
__2. Stationarity and Wold Representation Theorem__
	Stochastic process{$\cdots, X_{t-1}, X_t,X_{t+1},\cdots$} consisting of random variables indexed by time index t is a __time series__
	The stochastic behavior of {$X_t$} is determined by specifying the probability density/mass functions (pdf's)
