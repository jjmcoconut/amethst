### Basic Concepts

1. [[Periodicity]]
   
   Presence of regular and repeating patterns or cycles in the data over a specific time interval.
	
2. Seasonality
   
   In which regular or fixed interval shifts within the dataset in a continuous timeline. Would be a bell curve or saw tooth.
   
1. Trend
   
   In which there is no fixed interval and any divergence within the given dataset is a continuous timeline. The trend would be a Negative or Positive or Null Trend.

### Limitations
- The missing values are not supported by TSA.
- Data points must be linear in their relationship.
- Data transformations are mandatory, so they are little expensive(?)
- Models mostly work on univariate(one variable) data.
