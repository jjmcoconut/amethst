# Research Candidates

1. Scope 3's impact -  Does it affect the firm's profit (company image)?
2. Double materiality vs. Financial materiality
	- Can reporting impact materiality (carbon emissions, workforce diversity, ...) have a big impact on anything?
3. Does third-party auditing have a huge impact on
	- Profit
	- Reliability
	- How about the third party's revenue structure?
	- Will the firm try to hide the real information?
		- If it does not then there is no reason for independent auditors
	- Can it backfire?
		- More effort on hiding with existence of third-party auditors?
